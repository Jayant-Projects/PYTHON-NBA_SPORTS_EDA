# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the National Basketball Association (NBA)

Welcome to the comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the National Basketball Association (NBA) sports dataset. You can explore the project on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rjayant/nba-exploratory-data-analysis).

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to delve deep into the NBA dataset and uncover valuable insights. Here's a structured breakdown of the key steps:

### 1. Understanding Data
   - In this phase, we get to know our dataset inside out. We examine its structure, columns, and the type of information it contains.

### 2. Data Cleaning
   - We ensure our dataset is in tip-top shape by addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. This step sets the stage for accurate analysis.

### 3. Data Transformation
   - Sometimes, we need to reshape or augment our data to extract meaningful insights. We'll perform transformations as necessary.

### 4. EDA
   - The heart of the project! Here, we dig deep into the data, asking questions, and visualizing trends and patterns. We'll uncover interesting facts about the NBA.

### 5. Conclusion
   - The conclusion phase ties everything together. We summarize our findings, highlight key observations, identify trends, and offer actionable insights. This is where the data comes to life.
